**Chord Keys on Nico's fork:** [explore the mod and quick guide](https://bynicoheuser.github.io/Modded-Cycles/chord-keys/) · [open this fork's flasher](https://bynicoheuser.github.io/Modded-Cycles/flasher/).
This revision adds temporary harmony pads, three COLOR palettes and a SHAPE voicing/balance macro. **Nico reports testing version 1.2 on his Model:Cycles, including with the other Cycles mods, on 7 October 2026.** This is his hardware report; the upstream experimental classification is unchanged.
The new held-modifier and MIDI chord-output additions are experimental and await hardware testing.
The upstream links above belong to the original project; this fork's flasher includes the Chord Keys revision described here.

## Why

The Model:Cycles is a great little groovebox, but its firmware leaves some obvious things on the table:
the USB output only carries the stereo mix, there are just six machines, the tempo stops at 300 BPM,
and a few everyday gestures (muting, removing trigs) take more presses than they should.

Modded Cycles patches **your own copy** of the official OS to fix that. You pick the mods you want,
the page builds the firmware in your browser, and sends it to the Model:Cycles over USB.
Going back to the official firmware is one click away.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No Elektron firmware is included in this repository**, original or modified. You bring the official OS
> file from [elektron.se](https://www.elektron.se/support-downloads/modelcycles); the mods are applied to it on your computer.
> This is an independent project, not affiliated with or endorsed by Elektron. Flashing a modified OS is
> **at your own risk** and may void your warranty.

## The mods

| Mod | What you get | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **6-channel USB audio** | Each track gets its own USB channel (48 kHz / 32-bit): record six separate stems in your DAW. OS updates over USB keep working. | ✅ Tested |
| **Syntakt engines** | Up to five real Syntakt machines added next to the original six: **SD VINTAGE**, **CP VINTAGE**, **SY TOY**, **SY BITS** and **SY SWARM**, with the Syntakt's knob names and defaults. They are read from your own Syntakt OS file. | ✅ Tested |
| **Model-TG** | A full Sampler machine with seven playback modes, resampling, a beat-repeat page with master FX, slide trigs, Scale Lock and more, by [TinyGregAudio](https://github.com/TinyGregAudio/Model-TG). Works with the 6-channel mod and the Syntakt engines. | 🧪 Experimental |
| **Arpeggiator** | Hold several notes with RETRIG and they play as an arpeggio. `FUNC` + `RETRIG` adds direction (up, down, up/down, random, or in the order played) and range (1 to 4 octaves), saved with the pattern. | ✅ Tested |
| **Chord Keys** | Play the selected CHORD track with `TRIG 1–16` and see the played chord's name on screen. Choose each degree's TRI/7/9/11/13 in `FUNC` + `RETRIG`. COLOR selects DIATONIC, JAZZ or TENSION; SHAPE arranges and balances the notes. With Keys ON, T1–T6 always make temporary 9/11/13/SUS7/PARALLEL/V7 changes without selecting another track. Press a pad while holding a TRIG to replay the whole changed chord with a fresh attack. Keep T held across successive TRIGs to reuse its modifier. Releasing T keeps the current chord; later TRIGs return to their saved extension. Choose MIDI CHORD in FUNC + RETRIG for chord-note output, or ROOT for the original output. Record the attacks and HARMONY parameter locks. Improved controls also apply to existing patterns. Combines with every other Cycles mod, including Model-TG and the Syntakt engines. | 🧪 Experimental revision |
| **Tempo up to 546 BPM** | The TEMPO knob, tap tempo, MIDI clock and saved projects go past 300 BPM. Tempo-synced LFOs stay in time. | ✅ Tested |
| **Startup animation** | When the Model:Cycles starts, the four squares of the modded-cycles logo pop in and “modded-cycles” types itself underneath, instead of the original tile animation. Same duration. | ✅ Tested |
| **Easier trig removal** | A quick press on a step that holds a trig removes it, instead of opening it as a hold. | ✅ Tested |
| **Latching mute** | Hold `TRACK` and tap `FUNC`: mute mode stays on, no more holding `FUNC`. By [drumkilla](https://github.com/drumkilla/elektron-model-tweaks). | ✅ Tested |
| **Trig preview** | Sequencer stopped or paused: hold a step and press `PAGE` to hear it, with its note, length and p-locks. By drumkilla. | ✅ Tested |
| **Scrolling names** | Sound names too long for the screen scroll in the sound browser. By drumkilla. | ✅ Tested |
| **Samples OS** | Turns the Model:Cycles into a Model:Samples, built from both official OS files. Coming back needs a MIDI interface. | ✅ Tested |

Chord Keys can be combined with every other Cycles mod, including Model-TG and the Syntakt engines. Existing restrictions between other mods still apply; Samples OS is a separate install. Each mod is explained step by step, with the buttons to press, in the
**[guide](https://18nelli18.github.io/Modded-Cycles/guide/)**.

**Chord Keys:** Root, Scale and the I–VII extension rows remain per-track settings saved with the pattern.
The improved controls and HARMONY pads are permanent whenever Keys is ON on a CHORD track; the Controls and Pads
menu options have been removed. Existing patterns use these controls too: their saved SHAPE/COLOR values and locks
are preserved but interpreted with the improved behavior. Freshly initialized patterns start with Keys OFF. COLOR ranges
0–42 / 43–85 / 86–127 select DIATONIC / JAZZ / TENSION. SHAPE offers BASE, CLS0–3 and OPN0–3 with a balance for
each position. With a TRIG held, each new available T-pad press replays the whole changed chord with a fresh attack
at that TRIG's original velocity. Holding a pad does not repeat it. The last pad pressed wins; releasing it keeps
the changed chord sounding without an extra attack. Without a prepared pad, each new TRIG starts with its saved extension. With no TRIG held, press and hold T to prepare the next TRIG without changing the previous chord’s tail. Releasing T before the TRIG cancels that preparation; the next TRIG consumes it once.
LIVE RECORDING captures these attacks as notes with HARMONY locks; releases add no notes or locks.
Each attack keeps its own chord on playback, including when recording places a pad attack on the next step.
Recording over a step uses the stock note-recording rules, including replacement of its existing locks.
While a TRIG is held, the screen names the chord being played, including the current palette and temporary pad change,
for example Cmaj7 or Em9. HIGH LIMIT warns when the engine limits the root or removes voices in the high register;
the displayed harmonic name stays the same. HARMONY pad changes can be recorded as parameter locks and saved with the pattern; COLOR and SHAPE remain independent. Four voices maximum: extended m7♭5
keeps its diminished fifth and omits the third; PARALLEL and V7 are unavailable for diminished targets.

Chord Keys also combines with Model-TG, including its version with the Syntakt engines. On CHORD with Keys ON,
Root and Scale in the Chord Keys menu choose the keyboard notes; Model-TG’s Scale Lock continues to work on other
tracks and with Keys OFF. HARMONY locks stay separate from Model-TG’s Attack, Filter, Resonance and Sampler
settings, and existing Chord Keys projects keep their saved harmony locks. Existing restrictions between other
mods still apply. **Nico reports successful hardware testing of version 1.2 with the other Cycles mods.** This is
not an exhaustive test of every possible selection in the flasher. Samples OS is a separate installation. TRACK + T1–T6 still selects tracks.
Keys OFF restores ordinary pad playing and retrig/arp; the lower TRIG chord keys do not arpeggiate.

The 9 October Chord Keys optimization reduces processing work while preserving the sound, controls, MIDI output
and HARMONY recording. Audio matched sample for sample in firmware emulation; hardware performance has not been
measured, and this revision remains experimental.

## Install in four steps

<img src="docs/images/readme/flasher.png" alt="The web flasher, step 1: a list of mods with checkboxes, 6-channel USB audio ticked" width="100%">

1. **Open the [web flasher](https://18nelli18.github.io/Modded-Cycles/flasher/)** in Chrome, Edge or Opera on a desktop computer (it needs Web MIDI).
2. **Tick the mods you want.**
3. **Drop your official OS file**, `model-cycles_OS1.13.syx`, from the [Elektron download](https://www.elektron.se/support-downloads/modelcycles) (unzip it first).
   For the Syntakt engines, also drop `Syntakt_OS1.42.syx` ([download](https://www.elektron.se/support-downloads/syntakt); 1.41 works too).
4. **Connect the Model:Cycles over USB and press Flash.** Close Elektron Transfer first and leave the machine on its usual screen.
   The transfer takes about 30 seconds, then the Model:Cycles asks you to confirm with **YES**.

Everything runs in your browser: your files are never uploaded anywhere.

**Before you flash**, back up your projects and samples with Elektron Transfer.

<details>
<summary><b>Other ways to flash</b></summary>

- **Classic method.** If the fast method does not work on your setup, the flasher can also send the firmware the
  way Elektron Transfer does through `CONFIG › UPGRADE` (5 to 10 minutes).
- **Elektron Transfer.** The flasher has a *Download the .syx* button: drop that file onto Elektron Transfer yourself.
- **Command line.** See [Command line](#command-line) below.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Going back to the official firmware</b></summary>

Open the flasher, choose the **Official firmware** tab, drop your official OS file and flash. Before that,
set any track that uses an added machine (Syntakt engine or Sampler) back to one of the six original machines.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>If something goes wrong</b></summary>

If a Model:Cycles ever stops starting, it can always be recovered from its startup menu (`FUNC` + power on, then `TRIG 4`).
That menu only listens to the **MIDI IN** port, so you need a USB-MIDI interface and the scripts described in
[`FLASH.md`](FLASH.md) (in French). The guide has a [troubleshooting section](https://18nelli18.github.io/Modded-Cycles/guide/#trouble).

</details>

## Command line

The web flasher is a port of a pure-Python toolchain that lives in this repository: no compiler and no firmware needed.

```sh
python3 tools/build.py --list                       # every available mod
python3 tools/build.py -i model-cycles_OS1.13.syx -t 6ch-usbup,latching-mute,trig-preview,browser-scroll
./flash.sh                                           # macOS / Linux  (flash.bat on Windows)
```

Details in [`BUILD.md`](BUILD.md) and [`FLASH.md`](FLASH.md) (both in French). The web flasher is checked byte for byte
against the Python build (`tools/webflash_check.sh`, `tools/webbuild_check.sh`).

## How it is made

Every mod is checked in an emulator that runs the Model:Cycles' own code, and then on a real Model:Cycles before it is
marked *Tested*. The Syntakt engines are not imitations: their code and tables are taken from your Syntakt OS file and
relocated into the Model:Cycles firmware, and they produce the same samples as the Syntakt in emulation.

The research behind it (firmware analysis, hardware architecture, engine ports, measurements) is written up in the
[technical notes](notes/README.md), in French. Release notes for each flasher version are on the
[website](https://18nelli18.github.io/Modded-Cycles/#version).
